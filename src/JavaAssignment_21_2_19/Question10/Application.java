/**
 * Design classes having attributes and method(only skeleton) for a coffee shop. There are three different actors
 * in our scenario and listed the different actions they do is below
 * <p>
 * * Customer
 * - Pays the cash to the cashier and places his order, get a token number back
 * - Waits for the intimation that order for his token is ready
 * - Upon intimation/notification he collects the coffee and enjoys his drink
 * ( Assumption:  Customer waits till the coffee is done, he wont timeout and cancel the order.
 * Customer always likes the drink served. Exceptions like he not liking his coffee, he getting wrong coffee
 * are not considered to keep the design simple.)
 * <p>
 * * Cashier
 * - Takes an order and payment from the customer
 * - Upon payment, creates an order and places it into the order queue
 * - Intimates the customer that he has to wait for his token and gives him his token
 * ( Assumption: Token returned to the customer is the order order. Order queue is unlimited. With a simple
 * modification, we can design for a limited queue size)
 * <p>
 * * Barista
 * - Gets the next order from the queue
 * - Prepares the coffee
 * - Places the coffee in the completed order queue
 * - Places a notification that order for token is ready
